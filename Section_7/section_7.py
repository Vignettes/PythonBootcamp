# There are a few types of data in Python
#Bool (true false)
#int (integer)
#str (string)
#list (an ordered sequence of values of other data types)
#dict (a collection of key: values)

#Python uses "Dynamic Typing" to enable highly flexible reassignment of variables.
#eg awesomness = True can be moved to awesomness = "a dog"

#In Python you can use none in place of value 
#eg child = None this will allow callback later on.

#Quoting is like this quote = "That \"is good\" "

#To add in a variable in a message
#guess = 8
#print(f'{guess} is the number')

#for Udemy site use .format() at the end
#ex print("the {}".format(fruit,ripeness))

#convert to string str()
#convert to integer int()
